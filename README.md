# SocialMediaApp_NextJs

## About

This project aims to create a unique social media platform by integrating essential features from modern social networking sites and major services. I started with basic functionalities such as authentication and user posts. Although the project is still in progress, I plan to expand its features and enhance its usability in the future.

## Why

I wanted to develop a new service that embraces the functionality of current social media and major services, while offering something unique. Starting with key features like authentication and user posting, my goal is to create a more comprehensive and user-friendly platform as I continue to develop this project.
